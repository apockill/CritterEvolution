# CritterEvolution


This is an evolutionary game where the brains of critters get smarter over time. The critters live, mate, eat, hunt, scavenge, sleep, and die. When they mate, their decision-making process is put into the child and mutated. Over time the critters form flocks, families, protective groups, and other emergent behavior. I hope you enjoy this side project, it was quite fun to make!

Made using python2, pygame, and a couple smaller libraries.

Enjoy!

## Prerequisites
This project (unfortunately) uses Python 2.7. If anyone feels up to it, I'll merge the repo with anyone who makes it for python 3. 
Simply install pygame, numpy, and scipy through pip. To run, run 'python SimGame.py'
